      "question": "The specific charge of cathode rays",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Depends on the applied voltage",
        "b": "Depends on the nature of the gas in the tube",
        "c": "Is a constant",
        "d": "Depends on the metal used for cathode"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "The specific charge does not depend on applied voltage.",
        "b": "Cathode rays are the same regardless of the gas.",
        "c": "Correct. Specific charge (e/m) of cathode rays is constant.",
        "d": "The cathode material does not affect the specific charge."

      "explanations": {
        "a": "Neutrons have no charge, unlike cathode rays.",
        "b": "Protons move in the opposite direction in electric fields.",
        "c": "Correct. Cathode rays consist of electrons.",
        "d": "They are particles, not EM waves."
