      "question": "What was the primary conclusion drawn from the Franck-Hertz experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Electrons have mass",
        "b": "Electrons emit electromagnetic radiation",
        "c": "Atoms have quantized energy levels",
        "d": "Electrons travel in circular orbits"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Mass of electron was known before; not the focus of this experiment.",
        "b": "Radiation was not the direct observation.",
        "c": "Correct. The experiment demonstrated discrete energy levels in atoms.",
        "d": "This is a feature of Bohr's model but not tested in the Franck-Hertz setup."

      "question": "In the Franck-Hertz experiment with mercury, what is observed at 4.9 eV accelerating voltage?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "The electron current remains constant",
        "b": "Electrons are completely absorbed by mercury atoms",
        "c": "The current sharply drops due to inelastic collisions",
        "d": "The tube glows with visible light"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Current increases until inelastic collision occurs.",
        "b": "Electrons are not absorbed but lose energy.",
        "c": "Correct. Inelastic collisions reduce electron energy and current.",
        "d": "Mercury does not emit visible light like neon."

      "question": "What is the function of the mesh grid in the Franck-Hertz apparatus?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "To emit electrons",
        "b": "To accelerate electrons toward the collector",
        "c": "To detect excited atoms",
        "d": "To cool the electrons after collisions"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Electrons are emitted by the cathode.",
        "b": "Correct. A positive potential accelerates electrons toward the collector.",
        "c": "No detection mechanism in the grid.",
        "d": "Cooling is not a function of the grid."

      "correctAnswer": "b",

    {
      "question": "Why does the neon-filled Franck-Hertz tube show a visible glow during the experiment?",
      "answers": {
        "a": "Due to elastic collisions between electrons and neon",
        "b": "Due to ionization of neon",
        "c": "Due to de-excitation of neon atoms releasing visible light",
        "d": "Because of heating by thermionic emission"
      },
      "explanations": {
        "a": "Elastic collisions do not transfer enough energy for light emission.",
        "b": "Ionization leads to different phenomena than glowing.",
        "c": "Correct. Excited neon atoms de-excite and emit visible photons.",
        "d": "Thermionic emission occurs at the cathode, not related to light glow."
